== Revision 114 - 11th January, 2007 ==

Flexible multi-word tags landed SVN trunk - this was used as an opportunity to clean up some longstanding untidiness. Other known changes which will definitely be backwards incompatible are:

  * The `Tag` and `TaggedItem` models will *no longer set the `db_table` properties* in their inner `Meta` class - this means that unless you put the override back in yourself, *you'll have to rename your database tables* to `tagging_tag` and `tagging_taggeditem`, respectively. These were a hangover from when SQL queries were originally being written by hand - the appropriate table names are now plugged in using each model's `Options` (`_meta`).

  * `tagging.utils.get_tag_name_list` has been removed, as have all regular expressions related to tag input/validation.
