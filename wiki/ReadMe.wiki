= Django Tagging =

This is a generic tagging application for use in Django projects.

== Installation ==

Use the following command to check out the latest source:

{{{
svn checkout http://django-tagging.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ tagging
}}}

== Usage Instructions ==

Put this app into your project's `INSTALLED_APPS` setting and run `manage.py syncdb` to create the tables it requires.

== Implementation Details ==

The application defines two models:

  * `Tag`, which is a basic model representing a tag. Methods which return tags are implemented in its manager.
  * `TaggedItem`, which uses Django's Generic Relations functionality to represent the relationship between a tag and any other object. Methods which return objects based on the tags they have are implemented in its manager.
